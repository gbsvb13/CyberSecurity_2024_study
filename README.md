cybersecurity divided into two species, Offensive Security and Defensive Security.
Offensive Security is focused on breaking into system. it can be achieved by exploiting/abusing insecure setups and taking adventage of unenforced access control policies.

Defensive Security's two main tasks 
1.Preventing intrusions from occurring
2.Detecting intrusions when they occur and responding properly

Blue Team are part of Defensive Security.
